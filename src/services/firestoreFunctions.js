In some cases, surgery may be necessary to correct bulging that does not resolve after other treatments. If the cause is unclear, a general practitioner may refer you to a specialist for further examination. When lying down, use a pillow to keep your head elevated to help reduce swelling. Wearing sunglasses can protect your eyes if they are sensitive to bright light. If you wear contact lenses, remove them and wear glasses to give your eyes a rest."
