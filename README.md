## problem
- **Increased Screen Time:** In this digital era, many people spend their time in front of screens, whether for work, study, or entertainment. This can impact their eye health.
- **Limited Access to Services:** Not everyone can access eye health services easily.
- **Late Detection:** Some eye conditions may only show symptoms once the condition is quite severe.

Because of these issues, we developed a mobile app called EyeCare

## Our app
The EyeCare Mobile application can help user to detect symptoms of eye disease before being followed up by a doctor. This app will help users check their eyes and learn what food or nutrients are suitable for the eyes. We are still considering creating additional features to detect symptoms of color blindness in users.
